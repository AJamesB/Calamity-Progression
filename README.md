# Calamity Progression
**The (hopefully) ultimate Terraria Calamity progression list**

Just an itemised list of every weapon available at each stage of the game. 
> **_NOTE:_** Currently still HEAVILY a work in progress and only mage and classless, other classes will be done, and perhaps even armour and accessories. Also only Calamity weapons, but vanilla ones will be added at a later stage.

The bosses/events are ordered roughly according to Calamity's desired progression, but please don't feel like you have to progress in this order. However, a weapon might require that you've beaten bosses listed before the weapon. But the weapons will not require bosses listed after unless noted otherwise. 

Also, please note that some weapons might be obtainable at earlier stages (such as the Water Bolt) but doing so requires either lucky world gen, some sort of trick, or is too difficult for the average player (i.e. me).

Finally, the weapons at each stage are ordered alphabetically not by damage or any other ranking.

I plan to at some stage also add armour and accessories. But it might be a while before then.
I will also be updating the repository in this order:
- Mage Weapons (Vanilla)
- Rogue
- Summoner Weapons (Calamity)
- Summoner Weapons (Vanilla)
- Melee Weapons (Calamity)
